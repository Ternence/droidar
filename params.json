{"name":"DroidAR","tagline":"DroidAR Mobile Locationbased Augmented Reality Framework for Android","body":"DroidAR\r\n=======\r\n\r\nDroidAR is a framework for Augmented Reality on Android. Location based AR and marker based AR are both possible.\r\nAlso read the [wiki articles](https://github.com/bitstars/droidar/wiki/_pages) (or the [FAQ](https://github.com/bitstars/droidar/wiki/FAQ)) for more detailed information about DroidAR.\r\n\r\nThis framework can be used for many different scenarios, there are already some demo applications available (check the videos below).\r\nFor the latest news about DroidAR also visit our [blog](http://droidar.blogspot.com/).\r\n\r\nDroidAR can be freely downloaded and used under [the GNU GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) from this GitHub repository and is also available under a commercial license.\r\n\r\nDemo Videos\r\n=======\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=v2zyj9hPiDo\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/v2zyj9hPiDo/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Link to the DroidAR video\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8GtVcQN0CpY\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8GtVcQN0CpY/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Link to the DroidAR video\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=brlNkKmw8IY\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/brlNkKmw8IY/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Link to the DroidAR video\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=e0Xc00Csrg0\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/e0Xc00Csrg0/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Link to the DroidAR video\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=w5BrHLnG4no\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/w5BrHLnG4no/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Link to the DroidAR video\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=FH9vJ684j_U\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/FH9vJ684j_U/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Link to the DroidAR video\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=fEd0HORzStQ\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/fEd0HORzStQ/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Link to the DroidAR video\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\nContributing to the code\r\n=======\r\n\r\nContributing to DroidAR is easy on GitHub (that's the main reason why we switched from Google Code). \r\nClick \"Fork\" do your changes in your local copy of DroidAR and then push it back to the DroidAR repository. I will make a short instructions video about this soon.\r\n\r\nThere are some rules to allow an easy integration of your code and changes:\r\n\r\n- You have to use the default code formatting style of Eclipse\r\n- You should enable auto formatting whenever you save a file. This way you can't forget to format: Go to Preferences->Java->Editor->Save Actions and enable \"Format source code\" and \"Organize imports\". \r\n\r\nNow when you save the code is formatted automatically. This will avoid commit conflicts and changes in the code can be reviewed more easily. \r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\n\r\nLocation based AR and marker based AR are both possible. This framework can be used for many different scenarios, there are already some demo applications available.\r\n- Footstep recognition & Indoor AR\r\n- Locationbased Gaming & Crowdsourcing Framework\r\n\r\nSince the initial creation of the prototype of an augmented reality development tool in 2010, it was continuously improved and new features were added. The created development tool (SDK) enables other programmers to integrate augmented reality in their own applications.\r\nWe provided the SDK without charge with an Open Source License for non-commercial projects. It has since evolved into one of the most used open source augmented reality SDKs for the Android platform. The regular feedback from the developers as well as its application in seminars and practical project seminars, where the SDK was used as basis for their projects, greatly aided its improvement. The framework meets and raises interests and is currently being used by numerous developers around the globe. The recorded numbers of the site are about 1500 website visits per month with an increasing tendency. Also, 83% of the about 3200 developers return to the website following their initial visit.\r\n\r\nAlso take a look at the [DroidAR FAQ](https://github.com/bitstars/droidar/wiki/FAQ) and the other [Wiki pages](https://github.com/bitstars/droidar/wiki/_pages)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n=======\r\nA new instructions video is comming soon.
